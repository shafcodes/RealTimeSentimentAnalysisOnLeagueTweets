# RealTimeSentimentAnalysisOnLeagueTweets
Real-time Tweet sentiment analysis using Tweepy and Dash. The Tweets are currently specific for the use case of League of Legends. Specifically to track and understand the impact of the new champion releases.

*Problem statement:* Social media mining can be useful in gathering public opinions about a product, tool, utility, movies, or even an upgrade or patch of a software during it's life cycle. There are various questions that can be asked and addressed to understand the public opinion, sentiment assocaited with a specific keyword or the trend shifts.

In this specific work, I will focus on League of Legends and its newer champion releases. Often, large gaming companies that tend to release a new character to the general public, make the new character interesting and stronger than what they (ideally) should be in order to increase playerbase, to promote sales, or to encourage testing of the character. Typically, this entails several segregated groups of people. Of these groups, one of them focuses on how "broken" the character is and another group focuses on how "cool" the character is. The first group perpetrates a negative sentiment due to an opinion that a character is unfair, that it would be awful to play against the character, and that the character is too strong to promote fair gameplay. The second group is in awe of the new character and typically carries a positive sentiment that emphasizes the novelty of the character, the coolness of the character, and how excited they are to play the character.
Regardless, when there are thousands of Tweets that are flooding in every hour, it becomes hard for companies like Riot Games to keep track of the tweets and to understand the impact and penetration of negative sentiments. Often, it helps to know of in-game glitches, bugs, things that users hate the most about the game...etc., in real-time to intervene and improve gameplay experiences.

*Some questions that can be answered using the following approach:*
1. How does Twitter community recieve and percieve the new champion? 
2. What sentiment is associated with the Tweets tagged with (or have a mention of) the new champion? 
3. How persistent is the positive or negative opinion? 
4. What are some of the keywords associated with the negative and positive sentiments?
